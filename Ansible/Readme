Configuration Management:

Given a node (use Vagrant), setup SSH with best security practices (public/private, disable root login, 
allow restricted users etc). Then install MySQL on it, configure root password and create new user on it. 
Also setup Apache Web Server on it and serve a php file with phpinfo().

Extra Mile: Do it for Ubuntu and CentOS.
